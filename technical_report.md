## Theoretical Foundation

### Quantum Mechanical Principles

#### 1. Superposition Principle

The superposition principle states that a quantum system can exist in a linear combination of multiple states simultaneously. For a qubit, this is expressed as:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```

where |α|² + |β|² = 1, and |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the computational basis states.

**Security Implication**: Superposition enables the creation of non-orthogonal states that cannot be perfectly distinguished, forming the basis for eavesdropping detection.

#### 2. No-Cloning Theorem

The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This is mathematically expressed as:

```
There exists no unitary operator U such that U|ψ⟩|0⟩ = |ψ⟩|ψ⟩
```

**Security Implication**: Eve cannot create perfect copies of quantum states, making eavesdropping detectable through the introduction of errors.

#### 3. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

The uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```

**Security Implication**: Measuring one observable necessarily disturbs the conjugate observable, enabling eavesdropping detection.

#### 4. Bell Inequality and Entanglement

Bell inequalities provide a way to test for quantum entanglement and non-locality. For entangled states, Bell inequalities are violated, indicating genuine quantum correlations.

**Security Implication**: Entanglement enables device-independent QKD protocols that are secure even with untrusted devices.

### Information-Theoretic Security

QKD provides information-theoretic security, meaning that the security is guaranteed by the laws of physics rather than computational assumptions. The security proof relies on:

1. **Quantum Mechanics**: Fundamental physical principles
2. **Information Theory**: Mathematical framework for security analysis
3. **Privacy Amplification**: Process to extract secure keys from raw data

## BB84 Protocol Implementation

### Protocol Description

The BB84 protocol, proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, is the first and most widely studied QKD protocol. Our implementation includes:

#### Alice's Preparation
1. **Random Bit Generation**: Alice generates random bits (0 or 1)
2. **Random Basis Selection**: Alice randomly chooses between Z-basis (|0⟩, |1⟩) and X-basis (|+⟩, |-⟩)
3. **Qubit Preparation**: Alice prepares qubits according to her choices
4. **Transmission**: Alice sends qubits through quantum channel

#### Bob's Measurement
1. **Random Basis Selection**: Bob randomly chooses measurement basis
2. **Measurement**: Bob measures received qubits
3. **Detection**: Bob records measurement outcomes

#### Classical Sifting
1. **Basis Comparison**: Alice and Bob compare their basis choices
2. **Sifting**: Keep only measurements where bases match
3. **Raw Key**: Create raw key from sifted bits

#### Error Correction and Privacy Amplification
1. **Error Estimation**: Calculate quantum bit error rate (QBER)
2. **Error Correction**: Correct errors in raw key
3. **Privacy Amplification**: Extract final secure key

### Implementation Results

Our simulation results show:

- **Raw Key Rate**: 1000 bits per protocol run
- **Sifting Efficiency**: ~50% (due to random basis selection)
- **Final Key Rate**: ~25% of raw key (after error correction and privacy amplification)
- **QBER Threshold**: 11% for security

## Security Analysis

### Eavesdropping Detection

#### Intercept-Resend Attack
Eve's intercept-resend attack introduces errors with probability 25% when she chooses the wrong basis. The QBER increases according to:

```
QBER = p_eavesdrop × 0.25 + p_noise
```

where p_eavesdrop is the probability of eavesdropping and p_noise is the channel noise.

#### Security Threshold
The security threshold for BB84 is QBER = 11%. If QBER exceeds this threshold, the protocol is considered compromised.

### Security Parameters

Our analysis shows:

1. **Information-Theoretic Security**: Guaranteed by quantum mechanics
2. **Eavesdropping Detection**: QBER monitoring provides detection
3. **Key Rate vs Security**: Trade-off between key generation rate and security level
4. **Finite-Key Effects**: Security decreases with shorter key lengths

## Post-Quantum Cryptography Integration

### Hybrid QKD + PQC Systems

We implemented a hybrid system combining QKD with CRYSTALS-Kyber post-quantum cryptography:

#### Advantages

2. **Future-Proof**: Resistant to both classical and quantum attacks
3. **Flexibility**: Can adapt to different security requirements

#### Implementation Details
